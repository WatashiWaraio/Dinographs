## **🦖 Dinographs - Graph Visualization & Pathfinding Web App**

Welcome to Dinographs! 🌐🦕 This is a fun and educational web application designed to help you understand the magic of graph theory in a visual and interactive way using Vis.js. 🧠✨ With this app, you'll explore how to work with adjacency matrices and dive into the world of pathfinding by implementing the Dijkstra algorithm to discover the shortest paths on a graph! 🛤️🔍
created by me and my friend Miguel 👨‍💻👨‍💻, this simple yet powerful tool is here to guide you through the fascinating world of graphs.

🌟 Features:

🕸️ Graph Visualization: Easily create, visualize, and interact with your graphs in real-time.

📝 Adjacency Matrix: See how graphs are represented with adjacency matrices – essential for understanding graph structures.

🚀 Dijkstra Algorithm: Calculate the shortest path on your graph using Dijkstra's famous algorithm. Watch the results come to life on your graph! 📈✨

🖱️ Interactive UI: Add and manage nodes and edges with just a few clicks! The graph and matrix update instantly for smooth learning.
